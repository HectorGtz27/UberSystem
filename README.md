# UberSystem
To solve a problem as a developer, it is very useful to divide it into subproblems and generate a model that allows you to implement the solutions in code. Take a look at Uber, one of the most used apps in the world, to understand how it's built. Based on this analysis, I extract and define the objects, classes and methods that make up the application, I use UML to model it and, finally, using different languages ​​such as Java, PHP and Python, I implement the classes and objects of the application.
